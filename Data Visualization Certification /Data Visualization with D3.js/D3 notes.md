<h1>Data Visualization with D3.js</h1>

D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.

D3 is built to work with common web standards â€“ namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform
those data into different charts, graphs, and maps. In the Data Visualization with D3 courses, you'll learn how to work with data to create
different charts, graphs, hover elements, and other ingredients to create dynamic and attractive data visualizations.

<h2>Add Document Elements with D3</h2>
D3 has several methods that let you add and change elements in your document. The `select()` method selects one element from the document. It takes an argument for the name of the element you want and returns an HTML node for the first element in the document that matches the name. Here's an example:

`const anchor = d3.select("a");`

The above example finds the first anchor tag on the page and saves an HTML node for it in the variable `anchor`.

D3 selectors work much like CSS selectors. The two key functions are

- d3.select(): returns a selection containing the first element of the DOM that matches the selector.
- d3.selectAll(): returns a selection containing all elements of the DOM that match the selector.

Two other useful methods are append() and text().

The `append()` method takes an argument for the element you want to add to the document. It appends an HTML node to a selected item, and returns a handle to that node.

The `text()` method either sets the text of the selected node, or gets the current text. To set the value, you pass a string as an argument inside the parentheses of the method.

Here's an example that selects an unordered list, appends a list item, and adds text:

```
d3.select("ul")
  .append("li")
  .text("Very important item");

```

D3 allows you to chain several methods together with periods to perform a number of actions in a row.

<h2>Select a Group of Elements with D3</h2>
D3 also has the `selectAll()` method to select a group of elements. It returns an array of HTML nodes for all the items in the document that match the input string. Here's an example to select all the anchor tags in a document:

```const anchors = d3.selectAll("a");```

Like the `select()` method, `selectAll()` supports method chaining, and you can use it with other methods.

<h2>Work with Data in D3</h2>
The D3 library focuses on a data-driven approach. When you have a set of data, you can apply D3 methods to display it on the page. Data comes in many formats, but this challenge uses a simple array of numbers.

The first step is to make D3 aware of the data. The `data()` method is used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. The data set is passed as an argument to the method.

A common workflow pattern is to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. D3 has the `enter()` method for this purpose.

When `enter()` is combined with the `data()` method, it looks at the selected elements from the page and compares them to the number of data items in the set. If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.

Here is an example that selects a ul element and creates a new list item based on the number of entries in the array:

```
body>
  <ul></ul>
  <script>
    const dataset = ["a", "b", "c"];
    d3.select("ul").selectAll("li")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("li")
      .text("New item");
  </script>
</body>
```
It may seem confusing to select elements that don't exist yet. This code is telling D3 to first select the `ul` on the page. Next, select all list items, which returns an empty selection. Then the `data()` method reviews the dataset and runs the following code three times, once for each item in the array. The `enter()` method sees there are no `li` elements on the page, but it needs 3 (one for each piece of data in dataset). New `li` elements are appended to the `ul` and have the text New item.
